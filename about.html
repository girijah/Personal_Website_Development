	<p>since November 01,2015</p>

	<p>I'm an undergraduate Software Engineering student from Institute of Information Technology, Colombo. I just love to take part in competions and 
	develop my skills. Students who win the competitions, inspire me alot. I'm looking forward to post
	winners of the competitions every week.
	</p>	
	<p>
	The site is able to capture all news about upcoming competions and the latest happenings of code competions around the world.
	I really do this for developers and enthusiastic students to achieve more and more. I would be happy if this is really supportive for
	developers. Also it is amazing posting questions in the site. </p>

	<p> I hope you enjoy the coreSparker.com . Apart from my skills, i am developing both Windows & Android apps. I found windows phone development is very interesting because of amazing unique UI. During my non-coding time, i love watching movies, reading books, playing guitar,
	travelling & making garden.</p>
